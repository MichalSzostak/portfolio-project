    <h2>Celestial Code Chronicles</h2>
    <p >
        This project is a 2D RPG game designed to teach players how to code through interactive exercises. The game features a unique blend of Xianxia storytelling and coding challenges, 
        and utilizes Angular and Firebase for development. The project is just getting started and will be developed in my spare time as a study project.

    <h2>Python - Guess the Song app</h2>
    <p>
        This program is a Tkinter GUI-based song guessing game. It uses the pygame library to play music and displays songs' title and artist, in which users guess the correct song title by entering the answer into an entry box. The score is calculated and displayed to the user. The game continues with different random songs until the user makes two incorrect answers.
