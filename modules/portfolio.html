    <h3>Celestial Code Chronicles</h3>
    <p>
        This project is a 2D RPG game designed to teach players how to code through interactive exercises. The game features a unique blend of Xianxia storytelling and coding challenges, 
        and utilizes Angular and Firebase for development. The project is just getting started and will be developed in my spare time as a study project.
