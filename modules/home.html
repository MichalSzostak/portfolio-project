        Welcome to my portfolio website! I bring a diverse and well-rounded background to my role as a software developer. 
        Before my apprenticeship with Barclays, I spent a decade in various customer service roles, from front-line agent to CEO office complaint advisor. 
        My experience spans the software, gaming, and energy industries, giving me a unique perspective and a deep understanding of customer needs.

        As a 30+ year old, I started my software development journey at City of Glasgow College and was eventually accepted onto an Software Development apprenticeship with Barclays. 
        I would like to specialize in back-end infrastructure and cybersecurity, and my commitment to excellence is driven by my philosophical beliefs, 
        inspired by Alan Watts and the principles of Daoism and Transurfing.

        When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming or exploring some obscure ideas. My love for technology, dedication to everything I do, 
        and philosophical outlook make me a, hopefully, valuable asset to any team. Take a look at my portfolio to see what I can do, and let's work together to bring your project to life.
