    I'm Michal, a software developer with a diverse background and a passion for technology. 
    Growing up in a small village in northwestern Poland, I never imagined that my path would lead me to live in Scotland,
     where I began my software development journey in 2021.

<p>
    After enrolling in an Software Development HND course at City of Glasgow College, I found a new love for this field 
    and soon after, I was offered an apprenticeship at a Barclays' technology division. With a decade of experience in customer 
    service roles, assisting customers in the software, gaming, and energy industries, 
    I bring exceptional skills in technical support and communication to every project.</p>

<p>
    In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of fast-paced music and challenging games. 
    Whether it's dancing to psytrance, hi-tech, or other types of EDM, or playing squad-based tactical shooters and 
    resource management games, I find that these activities bring a unique perspective and energy to my work as a
    software developer.
</p>

<p>
    As a problem solver and critical thinker, I am always looking for new and innovative solutions to complex 
    technical challenges. I bring a keen sense of empathy and clear communication to my work, ensuring that my clients 
    receive the highest quality results.
</p>

<p>
    My ultimate goal is to continue to grow and make a positive impact in the world of technology.
    Whether it's working on cutting-edge software projects or exploring new and exciting trends in gaming, 
    I am driven by my passion for technology and my desire to constantly improve.
