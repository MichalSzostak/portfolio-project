<h1>Get to Know Me: A Personal Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        I'm Michal, a software developer with a diverse background and a passion for technology. 
        Growing up in a small village in northwestern Poland, I never imagined that my path would lead me to live in Scotland,
         where I began my software development journey in 2021.

        After enrolling in an Software Development HND course at City of Glasgow College, I found a new love for this field 
        and soon after, I was offered an apprenticeship at a Barclays' technology division. With a decade of experience in customer 
        service roles, assisting customers in the software, gaming, and energy industries, 
        I bring exceptional skills in technical support and communication to every project.

        In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of fast-paced music and challenging games. 
        Whether it's dancing to psytrance, hi-tech, or other oppresive types of EDM, or playing squad-based tactical shooters and 
        resource management games, I find that these activities bring a unique perspective and energy to my work as a
        software developer.
